Unofficial integration for **VandCenter Syd** water meters in Home Assistant. Monitor your household water consumption directly from the Smart Forsyning portal.

> **Note:** This integration is for customers of [VandCenter Syd](https://www.vandcentersyd.dk/) (Denmark). If you're not a customer, this integration won't work for you.

## Features

- **Real-time consumption** – Current total meter reading and daily usage statistics
- **Historical data** – Import up to 2 years of historical consumption data into Home Assistant's long-term statistics
- **Energy Dashboard support** – Track water usage alongside electricity and gas in the Home Assistant Energy Dashboard
- **Automatic authentication** – Handles token refresh automatically (tokens expire after 1 hour)
- **Multi-device support** – Automatically discovers all water meters associated with your account
- **Leak detection** – Access to alarm states (if available from your meter)

## Installation

### Via HACS (Recommended)

1. Add this repository to HACS as a [custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories):
   - Repository: `https://github.com/LovelessCodes/vandcenter_syd`
   - Category: Integration
2. Click **Download** in the HACS interface
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration** and search for "VandCenter Syd"

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `vandcenter_syd` folder from this repository into your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the integration via the UI

## Configuration

The integration requires your Smart Forsyning login credentials (email and password).    
These are used to authenticate with the API and are stored securely in Home Assistant.

### Finding Your Credentials

1. Visit [https://vandcenter.smartforsyning.dk](https://vandcenter.smartforsyning.dk)
2. Use the same email and password you use to log into the Smart Forsyning portal
3. The integration will automatically handle API authentication and token refresh

## Available Sensors

For each water meter discovered, the following sensors are created:

| Sensor | Description | State Class |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Daily Usage** | Yesterday's water consumption in m³ | `total` |
| **Total Reading** | Current cumulative meter reading (for Energy Dashboard) | `total_increasing` |
| **Average Daily** | Average consumption over the reporting period (last 14 days) | `total` |
| **Period Max** | Highest single-day consumption in the period (last 14 days) | `total` |

## Energy Dashboard Setup

To track water consumption in the Home Assistant Energy Dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings > Dashboards > Energy**
2. Click **Add Water Source**
3. Select your **Total Reading** sensor (e.g., `sensor.vandcenter_syd_total_reading`)
4. The integration will automatically calculate daily consumption from the total meter reading

**Note:** The first time you add the sensor, it may take up to 2 hours for historical data to appear in the Energy Dashboard.

## API Limitations

- **Update frequency**: Data is fetched every 6 hours to respect API rate limits
- **Resolution**: The API provides daily consumption buckets (not real-time hourly data)
- **Geographic restriction**: Only works for VandCenter Syd customers in Denmark

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid authentication" error
- Verify you're using the same email/password as the Smart Forsyning web portal
- Ensure your account has active water meters registered

### Sensors show "unavailable"
- Check Home Assistant logs for API connection errors
- The integration will automatically retry on token expiration

### No historical data in Energy Dashboard
- Historical import runs asynchronously after setup; wait 5-10 minutes
- Verify the **Total Reading** sensor (not Daily Usage) is added to the Energy Dashboard

### Missing meters
- Ensure your meters are visible in the Smart Forsyning web portal
- The integration only fetches meters associated with your primary location

## Technical Details

This integration uses the unofficial Smart Forsyning REST API:
- `GET /api/Customer/details` – Location and account information
- `GET /api/Customer/devices` – Device enumeration
- `POST /api/Stats/usage/{locationId}/devices` – Daily consumption statistics
- `POST /api/Stats/readings/devices` – Current meter readings
- `POST /api/Customer/login` – Authentication (automatic token refresh)

## Disclaimer

This is an unofficial integration and is not affiliated with or endorsed by [VandCenter Syd](https://www.vandcentersyd.dk/).    
Use at your own risk.    
Your credentials are stored locally in your Home Assistant instance and are only used to authenticate with the official Smart Forsyning API.
